# TrueTone Development Log

## Project Understanding âœ…

**Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Status**: Project initialized and requirements documented

### Key Understanding:
1. **Core Innovation**: Real-time YouTube translation with voice preservation
2. **Technical Challenge**: Maintaining speaker identity (pitch, tone, rhythm) in translated speech
3. **Architecture**: Chrome Extension + Python Backend with ML pipeline
4. **Target Latency**: < 3 seconds end-to-end for smooth UX

### Next Steps in SDLC:
1. **Phase 1**: Foundation setup
   - Chrome extension boilerplate
   - FastAPI backend structure
   - Basic audio capture
   - WebSocket communication

2. **Phase 2**: Core ML pipeline
   - Whisper integration
   - Translation service
   - Voice embedding
   - TTS synthesis

3. **Phase 3**: Integration & optimization
4. **Phase 4**: Testing & deployment
