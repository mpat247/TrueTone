# TrueTone Voice Synthesis Options

This document outlines the current evaluation of TTS (Text-to-Speech) options for the TrueTone project with a focus on Python 3.12 compatibility.

## Requirements

The voice synthesis component for TrueTone needs to:

- Be compatible with Python 3.12
- Support voice cloning/preservation
- Work with multiple languages
- Integrate with FastAPI backend
- Have reasonable performance on standard hardware

## Current Options Under Evaluation

### 1. TTS-Mozilla

- **Description**: A fork of Mozilla's TTS library with Python 3.12 support
- **Voice Cloning**: Yes, with XTTS v2 model
- **Multilingual**: Yes
- **Python 3.12**: Compatible
- **Installation**: `pip install TTS-mozilla`
- **Status**: Being evaluated

### 2. Piper TTS

- **Description**: Lightweight TTS system focused on performance
- **Voice Cloning**: Limited
- **Multilingual**: Yes
- **Python 3.12**: Partially compatible
- **Installation**: `pip install piper-tts`
- **Status**: Being evaluated

### 3. Alternative APIs

- **ElevenLabs**: High-quality commercial API
- **Azure Speech Service**: Microsoft's cloud-based TTS
- **Google Cloud TTS**: Google's TTS solution
- **Status**: Considering as fallback options

## Evaluation Process

1. Test installation and dependencies on Python 3.12
2. Evaluate voice quality and naturalness
3. Test voice cloning capabilities
4. Benchmark performance (speed, memory usage)
5. Test multilingual support
6. Assess ease of integration with FastAPI backend

## Next Steps

- Complete evaluation of each option
- Select most appropriate TTS solution
- Implement voice synthesis module
- Create integration with translation pipeline
