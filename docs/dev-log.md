# TrueTone Development Log

## Project Understanding âœ…

**Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Status**: Project initialized and requirements documented

### Key Understanding:
1. **Core Innovation**: Real-time YouTube translation with voice preservation
2. **Technical Challenge**: Maintaining speaker identity (pitch, tone, rhythm) in translated speech
3. **Architecture**: Chrome Extension + Python Backend with ML pipeline
4. **Target Latency**: < 3 seconds end-to-end for smooth UX

### Next Steps in SDLC:
1. **Phase 1**: Foundation setup
   - Chrome extension boilerplate
   - FastAPI backend structure
   - Basic audio capture
   - WebSocket communication

2. **Phase 2**: Core ML pipeline
   - Whisper integration
   - Translation service
   - Voice embedding
   - TTS synthesis

3. **Phase 3**: Integration & optimization
4. **Phase 4**: Testing & deployment

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ… COMPLETED

**Date**: July 4, 2025  
**Status**: Chrome Extension + Basic Backend Fully Operational

### âœ… Completed Tasks:
1. **Project Structure Created**:
   - Chrome extension boilerplate with complete functionality
   - FastAPI backend structure with WebSocket support
   - Documentation and configuration files
   - Git repository initialized and pushed to GitHub

2. **Chrome Extension Built & Working**:
   - `manifest.json` - Chrome extension manifest v3 with proper permissions
   - `popup.html` - Beautiful gradient UI with professional design
   - `popup.js` - Complete extension control logic and WebSocket communication
   - `content-script.js` - YouTube page injection and audio capture setup
   - `background.js` - Service worker for tab capture and messaging
   - `styles.css` - Custom styling with TrueTone branding
   - **PNG Icons** - Created in all required sizes (16, 32, 48, 128) with gradient design

3. **Backend Foundation Working**:
   - `main.py` - FastAPI server with WebSocket support and health checks
   - Real-time WebSocket communication established
   - CORS configuration for Chrome extension communication
   - Audio processing pipeline structure ready
   - Logging and error handling implemented

4. **Development Infrastructure**:
   - `start_backend.sh` - Backend startup script
   - `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for ML pipeline
   - `.gitignore` - Proper Git ignore configuration
   - Complete documentation with setup instructions

### ðŸŽ¯ Successfully Tested & Verified:
- âœ… Chrome extension loads without errors
- âœ… Beautiful gradient popup UI displays correctly
- âœ… YouTube detection and integration working
- âœ… Extension icons display properly in Chrome toolbar
- âœ… Backend server starts and responds to health checks
- âœ… WebSocket communication framework established
- âœ… Project properly committed and pushed to GitHub

### ðŸ“‹ Ready for Phase 2:
- ML Pipeline Integration (Whisper, Translation, TTS)
- Real-time audio processing implementation
- Voice cloning and synthesis integration

---

## Phase 2: Core ML Pipeline (NEXT)

**Target**: Integrate the core machine learning models for audio processing

### ðŸŽ¯ Upcoming Tasks:
1. **Whisper Integration**:
   - Install and configure Whisper model
   - Implement real-time transcription
   - Audio chunking and processing

2. **Translation Service**:
   - HuggingFace transformer integration
   - Language detection and translation
   - Text processing and formatting

3. **Voice Cloning Pipeline**:
   - Resemblyzer for voice embedding
   - Coqui TTS for voice synthesis
   - Voice characteristic preservation

4. **Audio Processing**:
   - Real-time audio capture from YouTube
   - Audio format conversion and streaming
   - Synchronization with video playback
